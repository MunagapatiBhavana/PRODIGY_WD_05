I designed a weather application that provides real-time weather information by fetching data from a weather API. The application offers the following features:

Location-Based Weather: Automatically fetches and displays current weather conditions based on the user's location.
User-Inputted Location: Allows users to input any location to retrieve and display the current weather conditions and temperature.
Detailed Weather Data: Displays present weather conditions including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.
The application is user-friendly and provides an intuitive interface for quick and easy access to weather information.
